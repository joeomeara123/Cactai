## Project Overview

**CactAI** is the "Ecosia for AI conversations" - a social good AI chatbot platform that donates 40% of revenue to environmental causes. Every query users make helps plant trees while providing access to advanced AI models.

### Core Mission
- Users chat with AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Every query generates ~£0.04 in processing costs
- 40% (£0.016) goes to reforestation efforts
- £1 = 2.5 trees planted (based on Ecosia model)
- Result: ~0.04 trees planted per query

### Key Features
- 🤖 **Multi-model AI Chat**: Access GPT-4 and other leading AI models
- 🌳 **Real-time Environmental Impact**: Track trees planted from conversations
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication**: Google OAuth via Supabase
- 📊 **Personal Dashboard**: Impact tracking and milestone achievements
- 🎯 **Gamification**: Tree planting milestones and achievements
- 🏢 **Enterprise-grade**: Production-ready architecture and monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Production Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend), Supabase (Backend)
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging, error tracking, performance monitoring
- **Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, audit logging
- **Caching**: Redis for sessions, query optimization

## 🚨 Recent Issues and Resolutions

### The 405 Error Problem (Commits 72e6b9b - Latest)

**Issue Summary:**  
After commit `08c8a4d`, subsequent commits attempted to fix "405 Method Not Allowed" errors encountered in Vercel deployment. However, these "fixes" created more problems than they solved.

**Root Cause Analysis:**  
1. **Original Problem**: 405 errors were a deployment/infrastructure issue, not application code issue
2. **Misguided Solution**: Switched from working API routes to Server Actions incorrectly
3. **Critical Mistake**: Modified Server Action file but frontend still called API routes
4. **Functionality Loss**: Stripped out OpenAI integration, database operations, and error handling

**What Went Wrong in Commit 72e6b9b:**
- ❌ **Removed 130 lines** of working OpenAI integration (`createChatCompletion`, `countTokens`)
- ❌ **Eliminated database operations** (`DatabaseClient`, `recordQuery`, impact calculations)
- ❌ **Created architectural mismatch**: Frontend calls `/api/chat` but "fix" was in Server Actions
- ❌ **Replaced real AI responses** with hardcoded diagnostic messages
- ❌ **Broke tree counting and environmental impact tracking**

**The Fundamental Error:**
```
Frontend: fetch('/api/chat') → API Route (still broken)
Backend: Server Action ("fixed" but never called)
Result: Frontend gets 405 errors, backend "fix" never executes
```

**Correct Solution:**
Instead of changing application architecture, the 405 errors should have been fixed by:
1. Vercel deployment configuration (`vercel.json`)
2. Environment variable validation in production
3. API route headers and CORS configuration
4. Or proper Server Action integration (not partial implementation)

### Current Working Architecture (Commit 08c8a4d)

**✅ What Works:**
- **Frontend**: `ChatInterface.tsx` calls `fetch('/api/chat')` with proper error handling
- **Backend**: `/api/chat/route.ts` handles requests with full OpenAI integration
- **Flow**: Frontend → API Route → OpenAI API → Database → Tree Counting → Response
- **Features**: Real AI responses, accurate tree planting calculations, proper database recording

**✅ Verified Components:**
- OpenAI API integration (tested with 82 models available)
- Database connectivity (all 5 tables operational)
- Authentication flow (Google OAuth working)
- TypeScript compilation (zero errors)
- Development server (running on localhost:3000)

This documentation represents a stable, working implementation of the social good AI platform concept. The current version (08c8a4d) provides full functionality with proper API route architecture, comprehensive error handling, and reliable environmental impact tracking.
